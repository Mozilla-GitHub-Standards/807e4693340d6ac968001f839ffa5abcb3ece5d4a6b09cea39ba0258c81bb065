# about:home Snippets for July 2012 campaign

This promotional campaign happened to coincide with an international sporting event.

There are two snippets. One features a video highlighting the international, multilingual 
nature of Firefox. The other promotes a collection of international flag personas.

Localized strings can be found at http://l10n.mozilla-community.org/~pascalc/langchecker/?action=translate&file=olympics.lang

The CSS animation was done by Particle (particularplace.com), and their original, unminified 
code is included here as well.
