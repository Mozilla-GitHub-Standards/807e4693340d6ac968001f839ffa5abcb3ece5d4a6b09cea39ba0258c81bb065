# Standard Snippet JS

This is the Javascript that is always sent by the snippets service. It's main
purpose is to randomly choose a snippet and display it to the user.

See also [the snippets service repository](https://github.com/mozilla/snippets-service/blob/master/snippets/base/templates/base/includes/snippet_js.html) for the latest version.
