# Split Snippet

The split snippet is a snippet that has a normal snippet and an alternative
snippet. Most of the time the normal snippet is the only one seen, but there is
a chance that in it's place the alternative snippet will be shown instead.

The alternative snippet only has a chance to show when the split snippet is
chosen by the random snippet choice that normally happens on about home. If, for
example, there are 4 snippets available and the alternative snippet has a 10%
chance of being seen, the alternative snippet will be seen 25% * 10% = 2.5% of
the time, while the normal snippet will be seen 25% - 2.5% = 22.5% of the time.
The other 3 snippets will all be seen 25% of the time as usual.
